# BuDongSan
An OpenStreetMap based realtor tycoon game. BuDongSan (부동산) is the Korean word for real estate. Source code can be found on the [develop](https://github.com/MRVDH/budongsan/tree/develop) branch. Contributions are always welcome!

## How to play
Payouts are done default every hour but the game speed can be set to minutes in the settings. I would recommend taking out a loan to start subletting some property and then buy property when you can. You can buy and rent any property in the world as long as the building is on OpenStreetMap. To go to an area or address look it up in the search bar in the top right corner.

## Note
This is a prototype. It's probably unbalanced and there is no end game yet. I'm thinking of turning it into a multiplayer game to make it more interesting and competitive.
